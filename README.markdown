Issues with design:
Having different small text on news items (eg 00.00.00 via twitter / 3 videos) I'm think this would have to be consistent for each item, most likley 00.00.00 via twitter etc
As discussed - sidebar images now all hard coded, you can just upload new ones, change links (easy code, no worries)
